## Animals Vax Atlas: Comparative Immunogenomics of Human-Mouse Vaccine and Infection Responses

---

## I. INTRODUCTION & RESEARCH FRAMEWORK

### I.A Study Rationale & Objectives
- **Core Scientific Question:** To what degree do murine models accurately mirror human blood transcriptomic dynamics during vaccination, acute bacterial infection, and systemic sterile injury?
- **The Translational Conundrum:** Individual orthologous gene-level correlations between mice and humans are frequently poor or inconsistent, casting doubt on preclinical murine translatability.
- **Central Hypothesis:** Higher-order biological structures—specifically functional pathways, Blood Transcription Modules (BTMs), and coordinated gene networks—are evolutionarily conserved across species, retaining high predictive fidelity even when individual gene effect sizes diverge.
- **Key Findings:** 
  1. Shifting from gene-centric to pathway-level metrics substantially elevates cross-species concordance.
  2. Translational fidelity scales monotonically with stimulus intensity: systemic injuries and acute bacterial infections show robust conservation, while milder vaccination stimuli exhibit greater species-specific divergence.
  3. Expression divergence between orthologs is driven by divergent *cis*-regulatory promoter architecture rather than protein-coding sequence identity or codon evolution.

### I.B Study Design
- **Comparative Design:** Parallel time-course blood transcriptomic profiling of matched perturbations across humans (*Homo sapiens*) and laboratory mice (*Mus musculus*).
- **Perturbations Analyzed:** Six matched immune and injury conditions spanning viral-antigen vaccination, Gram-positive bacteremia, Gram-negative sepsis, and major sterile tissue trauma.
- **Data Repositories:** Publicly available transcriptomic cohorts retrieved from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and NCBI BioProject databases.
- **Analytical Trajectory:** Automated data curation $\to$ multi-level quality control $\to$ platform-specific normalization $\to$ maximum variance probe collapsing $\to$ linear modeling (limma DGE) $\to$ pathway enrichment (fgsea) $\to$ macroevolutionary divergence modeling $\to$ predictive classification (ROC/AUC) $\to$ structural/regulatory evolutionary genomics $\to$ multi-modal statistical modeling (`tidymodels`).

## III. QUALITY CONTROL & PREPROCESSING

### III.A Array Quality Metrics & Outlier Detection
Prior to integration, all expression datasets were evaluated for technical fidelity via `1_QualityControl.Rmd`:
1. **ArrayQualityMetrics (`arrayQualitymetrics`):** Assessed distance matrices, boxplots of signal intensities, and pooled RNA degradation gradients.
2. **Relative Log Expression (RLE):** 
   $$\text{RLE}_{gi} = \log_2(E_{gi}) - \operatorname{median}_{j}(\log_2(E_{gj}))$$
   Samples exhibiting anomalous interquartile range (IQR) divergence or median shifts $>2.5$ standard deviations from the cohort centroid were flagged and excluded.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Outliers exceeding 2 standard deviations across PC1 and PC2 were visually inspected and removed if technical confounding (e.g., severe hybridisation failure) was confirmed.

### III.B Platform-Specific Normalization
Microarray intensity matrices were processed using technology-specific algorithms in `2_Preprocessing_and_DGE.Rmd`:
- **Affymetrix Oligonucleotide Arrays (Human Gene 1.0 ST):** Raw probe cell intensity files (.CEL) were preprocessed with the **Robust Multi-array Average (RMA)** algorithm via `affy`/`oligo`, executing background correction, quantile normalization, and median-polish probe set summarization.
- **Illumina BeadChips & Agilent Arrays:** Expression matrices were $\log_2$-transformed and subjected to **between-array quantile normalization** using `limma::normalizeBetweenArrays(method = "quantile")` to enforce identical empirical distributions across arrays while preserving relative biological rank orders.

### III.C Probe-to-Gene Annotation & Maximum Variance Collapsing
To map platform-specific probe identifiers to standardized gene nomenclatures (HGNC symbols for human; MGI symbols for mouse), annotation tables were retrieved via Bioconductor platform packages (`illuminaHumanv4.db`, `hugene10sttranscriptcluster.db`, `biomaRt`).

**Probe Collapsing Strategy:** Microarray platforms frequently feature multiple independent probe sets interrogating the same gene locus. To prevent signal dampening or dilution caused by unweighted averaging across non-responsive or poorly hybridising probes, we employed a **maximum variance probe selection strategy**:
$$\text{Representative Probe}(g) = \arg\max_{p \in \mathcal{P}_g} \left( \operatorname{Var}_{s \in \mathcal{S}} \left( \log_2 I_{p,s} \right) \right)$$
where $\mathcal{P}_g$ is the set of all probes mapping to gene $g$, and $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all biological samples. For each gene, only the single probe displaying the greatest expression variance across the experiment was retained.

---

## IV. DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION & STATISTICAL THRESHOLDS

### IV.A Linear Modeling with Limma
Differential gene expression was modeled independently for each condition and species using linear models with Empirical Bayes variance moderation via `limma`:
1. **Model Formulation:** For each condition, an unintercepted design matrix was constructed:
   $$\mathbf{Y}_{g} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}_g + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_g, \quad \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_g \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_g^2 \mathbf{I})$$
   where $\mathbf{X}$ represents experimental groups parameterized by organism, stimulus, and timepoint.
2. **Contrasts:** Post-treatment timepoints were contrasted directly against their matched pre-treatment Day 0 baseline (e.g., $\text{Day 1} - \text{Day 0}$, $\text{Day 3} - \text{Day 0}$, $\text{Day 7} - \text{Day 0}$).
3. **Variance Shrinkage (eBayes):** Squeeze gene-wise sample variances toward a global intensity-dependent prior using `limma::eBayes(fit, trend = TRUE)`:
   $$\tilde{s}_g^2 = \frac{d_0 s_0^2 + d_g s_g^2}{d_0 + d_g}$$
   moderating the test statistics against small sample size instability.

### IV.B Statistical Significance Limits
- **DGE Threshold:** Genes were classified as significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) if they satisfied:
  $$\text{adj. } P\text{-value (BH FDR)} \le 0.05$$
  Effect size magnitude ($\log_2\text{FC}$) was preserved continuously without arbitrary threshold truncation to power downstream rank-based pathway analyses.
- **GSEA Significance Threshold:** When evaluating functional modules via `fgsea`, the standard False Discovery Rate limit was established at:
  $$\text{padj} \le 0.25$$
  This $\le 0.25$ FDR threshold is standard for GSEA, capturing broader coordinated pathway trends (especially relevant for weaker stimuli like vaccination).

## V. FUNCTIONAL PATHWAY ENRICHMENT (BTMs & HALLMARKS)

### V.A Blood Transcription Modules (BTMs)
The primary analytical unit for immune response evaluation comprised 346 Blood Transcription Modules (Li et al., *Nat Immunol* 2014), capturing specific leukocyte subsets (T cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells) and intrinsic functional states (interferon response, inflammatory chemokines, cell cycle). Modules are grouped hierarchically into 16 broader physiological domains.

### V.B Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (fgsea)
For each contrast, orthologous genes were ranked by their moderated $t$-statistic ($t_g$):
$$\text{Rank}(g) = t_g$$
Enrichment scores ($ES$) across BTMs and MSigDB Hallmarks (50 gene sets) were computed using `fgsea::fgsea()`, testing for non-random distribution of module members within the ranked transcriptome via an adaptive multi-level split Monte Carlo permutation scheme (1,000 to 10,000 permutations). Enrichment scores were normalized for gene set size ($NES$).

---

## VI. UNIFIED CROSS-SPECIES COMPARATIVE ANALYSES & FIGURE 43 ARCHITECTURE

Notebooks `3.1_Comparing_Human_Mouse_DGE_analyses.Rmd`, `3.2_Comparing_Human_Mouse_GSEA.Rmd`, and `3.3_Comparing_Human_Mouse_Functional_Analyses.Rmd` consolidate all 6 conditions into unified comparative frameworks.

### VI.A Macroevolutionary Expression Divergence & Inverse-Variance Weighting
For each 1:1 orthologous gene pair across matched experimental conditions:
1. **Directional Effect Size Divergence:**
   $$\Delta \log_2\text{FC} = \log_2\text{FC}_{\text{Human}} - \log_2\text{FC}_{\text{Mouse}}$$
2. **Coefficient of Variation (CV):**
   $$CV = \frac{SD}{|\text{mean } \log_2\text{FC}|}$$
3. **Inverse-Variance Statistical Weighting:**
   To ensure that downstream cross-species correlation and distance evaluations were not biased by noisy low-expression probes, joint standard error-based inverse weights were formulated:
   $$W_{SE} = \frac{1}{SE_{\text{Human}}^2 + SE_{\text{Mouse}}^2}$$
   where $SE$ represents the standard error from the linear model fit.

### VI.B Figure 43: Detailed Panel Methodologies

#### Figure 43a | Functional Module NES Correlation Dynamics
- **Objective:** Quantify the temporal concordance of higher-order immune programs across human and murine systems.
- **Computation:** For each condition and timepoint pair, the vector of module Normalized Enrichment Scores ($NES$) was extracted for humans ($\mathbf{NES}_H$) and mice ($\mathbf{NES}_M$).
- **Correlation Metric:** Spearman rank correlation ($\rho$) and Pearson linear correlation ($r$) were computed between species across functional modules over time.
- **Stratified Filtering:** To evaluate the effect of statistical stringency on translatability, correlations were computed and compared across three nested module subsets:
  1. **All Enriched Modules:** Unfiltered module sets.
  2. **Mouse-Significant Modules:** Modules meeting $\text{padj} \le 0.25$ in the mouse model.
  3. **Dual-Significant Modules:** Modules meeting $\text{padj} \le 0.25$ concordantly in both human and mouse cohorts.

#### Figure 43b | Predictive Classification Performance (ROC & AUC)
- **Objective:** Determine whether murine pathway signatures can accurately predict the regulatory status of human biological modules.
- **Classification Task:** Murine effect metrics ($NES$ or mean $\log_2\text{FC}$) were deployed as continuous decision scores to classify human modules as significantly up- or down-regulated.
- **Timepoint Regimes:**
  - **Equal Timepoints:** Matched chronological intervals (e.g., Human Day 1 vs. Mouse Day 1).
  - **Different Timepoints:** Cross-temporal evaluations accommodating species differences in kinetic velocity (e.g., murine Day 1 modeling human Day 3 or Day 7).
- **Validation Controls:** Murine model performance was benchmarked against:
  - **Permutation Controls:** Null distributions generated by randomly shuffling module labels ($N = 1,000$ iterations).
  - **Biological Controls:** Unrelated baseline pathological cohorts (e.g., Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, DMD) to establish empirical specificity baselines.
- **Performance Metrics:** Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were generated using `pROC` and `yardstick`.

#### Figure 43c | Leading-Edge Gene (LEG) Conservation
- **Objective:** Dissect whether module-level conservation is driven by identical core genes or alternative pathway components.
- **Extraction:** For each enriched BTM ($\text{padj} \le 0.25$), the Leading-Edge Genes (LEGs)—genes accounting for the core enrichment signal prior to the peak running enrichment score—were extracted for both species.
- **Categorization:** Genes within each module were partitioned into:
  1. **Shared LEGs:** Present in the leading edge of both human and mouse.
  2. **Human-Specific LEGs:** Driving enrichment exclusively in humans.
  3. **Mouse-Specific LEGs:** Driving enrichment exclusively in mice.
  4. **Non-LEGs:** Module members not contributing to the core leading-edge signal.
- **Visualization:** Proportions and counts are visualized via stacked and faceted barplots across conditions.

#### Figure 43d | Gene Rank Conservation in Core Immune Modules
- **Objective:** Evaluate the conservation of intra-module gene prioritization between human and mouse.
- **Focal Module:** Illustrated using the *"immune activation - generic cluster"* (BTM M37.0; 347 genes), representing innate inflammatory, Toll-like receptor, and chemokine signaling programs.
- **Composite Rank Metric:** For each gene $g$, a rank score combining effect size and statistical significance was formulated:
  $$\text{Rank Score}_g = \log_2(\text{FC}_g) \times \left( -\log_{10}(P\text{-value}_g) \right)$$
- **Ranking Vector:** All orthologous module genes were ranked in descending order separately within human ($\text{Rank}_H$) and mouse ($\text{Rank}_M$). Spearman rank correlation was calculated between the two vectors.
- **Visual Mapping:** A parallel-axis rank trajectory plot connects gene positions between human (left axis, H) and mouse (right axis, M):
  - **Blue Lines:** Shared LEGs (conserved core drivers).
  - **Black Lines:** Human-specific LEGs.
  - **Dark Gray Lines:** Mouse-specific LEGs.
  - **Light Gray Lines:** Non-LEGs (background module members).

## VII. EVOLUTIONARY GENOMICS: PROTEIN CODING VS. CIS-REGULATORY ARCHITECTURE

Notebooks `5.1_EvolutionaryAnalysis_Protein.Rmd` and `5.2_EvolutionaryAnalysis_Regulation.Rmd` assess whether transcriptomic divergence is governed by structural coding evolution or regulatory rewiring.

### VII.A Coding Sequence (CDS) Acquisition & Longest Isoform Selection
1. **Source:** High-confidence 1:1 orthologous gene pairs were identified via Ensembl BioMart (`hsapiens_gene_ensembl` and `mmusculus_gene_ensembl`) using `biomaRt`.
2. **Partitioned Retrieval:** Due to query volume and server timeout constraints, mouse CDS records were programmatically split into 3 balanced partitions (`target_map_mouse_part1`, `part2`, `part3`) and queried in chunks of 100 genes.
3. **Isoform Resolution (Longest Canonical CDS):** Because alternative splicing produces multiple transcripts per Ensembl Gene ID, a filtering step retained only the longest coding sequence:
   $$\text{Canonical CDS}_g = \arg\max_{t \in \mathcal{T}_g} \left( \operatorname{nchar}(\text{coding}_{g,t}) \right)$$
   Records with `"Sequence unavailable"` or non-coding annotations were purged.

### VII.B Pairwise Nucleotide Global Alignment & Distance Computation
1. **Sequence Sanitization:** Leading/trailing whitespace and newline delimiters were stripped, and nucleotide sequences were converted to uppercase.
2. **Global Needleman-Wunsch Alignment:** Pairwise global alignment was performed using `pwalign::pairwiseAlignment(type = "global")` between human and mouse CDS strings:
   ```r
   dna_align <- pwalign::pairwiseAlignment(
     Biostrings::DNAString(human_cds),
     Biostrings::DNAString(mouse_cds),
     type = "global"
   )
   ```
3. **Conversion to Alignment Object:** Aligned pattern and subject strings—preserving gap characters (`'-'`)—were converted to character matrices and converted into `DNAbin` objects via `ape::as.alignment()` and `ape::as.DNAbin()`.
4. **Kimura 2-Parameter (K80) Distance Calculation:** Molecular evolutionary distances were computed using `ape::dist.dna(bin_dna, model = "K80")`. The Kimura K80 model corrects for multiple hits and differential rates between transitions ($P$) and transversions ($Q$):
   $$d_{\text{K80}} = -\frac{1}{2}\ln(1 - 2P - Q) - \frac{1}{4}\ln(1 - 2Q)$$
   Jukes-Cantor (JC69) distances were computed in parallel as a sensitivity control.
5. **Protein Sequence Identity:** Amino acid sequence identity percentages (`identity_human2mouse` and `identity_mouse2human`) were extracted from Ensembl BioMart homology tables.

### VII.C Cis-Regulatory Element (cCRE) Architecture from ENCODE
To interrogate promoter and enhancer rewiring, Candidate Cis-Regulatory Elements (cCREs) were integrated from the ENCODE project:
- **Human Reference:** GRCh38 cCRE catalogue.
- **Mouse Reference:** mm10 cCRE catalogue.
- **Functional Classes Analyzed:**
  - **PLS:** Promoter-Like Signatures (high DNase, high H3K4me3, centered within 200 bp of TSS).
  - **pELS / dELS:** Proximal and Distal Enhancer-Like Signatures (high DNase, high H3K27ac).
  - **CTCF-bound:** Elements demonstrating high CTCF occupancy (chromatin architectural boundaries).
- **Homology Mapping:** cCREs were assigned to target orthologs based on genomic distance to the primary Transcription Start Site (TSS) ($\pm 2\text{ kb}$ for promoters, $\pm 50\text{ kb}$ for enhancers). Regulatory conservation scores were calculated based on reciprocal element presence and transcription factor binding site conservation.

## VIII. MULTI-MODAL STATISTICAL MODELING (`tidymodels`)

Two complementary scripts perform statistical modelling:

- `scripts_notebooks/6_Statistical_Modelling.Rmd` — the original, exploratory script (feature matrix + Random Forest / Elastic Net with in-sample metrics).
- `Modelling/6_Statistical_Modelling_v2.Rmd` — the consolidated **mouse-to-human transfer** pipeline used for the manuscript (Figure 7). It predicts the **human** response gene by gene using **leave-one-pathogen-out (LOCO)** cross-validation.

### VIII.A Original Exploratory Script (`6_Statistical_Modelling.Rmd`)

A master feature matrix (`human_mouse_statsmodelling_parameters_values.rds`) was assembled by merging:
1. **Structural Coding Evolution:** Kimura K80 CDS distance (`dist_k80`), amino acid identity %.
2. **Transcriptional Concordance:** $\Delta \log_2\text{FC}$, sampling stability $SD$, linear model standard error $SE$.
3. **Cis-Regulatory Features:** Promoter cCRE class presence (PLS, pELS, dELS, CTCF) in human and mouse, cCRE distance metrics.
4. **Transcription Factor (TF) Networks:** Shared vs. species-unique TF binding site counts within orthologous promoters.
5. **Functional Domain Annotations:** BTM module category, immune vs. non-immune designation.

Algorithms were Random Forest classifiers/regressors (`ranger`) and regularized Elastic Net regression (`glmnet`), evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation repeated 5 times and ranked by permutation-based Variable Importance in Projection (`vip::vip()`).

### VIII.B Consolidated Transfer Pipeline (`6_Statistical_Modelling_v2.Rmd`)

#### VIII.B.1 Feature layers (two nested sets)
Instead of adding six independent layers, the v2 pipeline uses two nested feature sets, separating the transferable biological signal from the mouse magnitude:
1. **DGE Baseline** — mouse differential-expression summary: absolute rank (`rank_mouse`) for rank transfer; direction sign (`sign_mouse`) for directional concordance; `mean_log2fc_mouse`, BTM-only rank (`rank_mouse_btm`) and precision (`inverse_se_mouse`) for shared-LEG classification.
2. **Full + BTM** — adds the biological layers: sequence evolution (`dist_k80`, `identity_human2mouse`), TF features (`n_tf_total`, `pct_tf_shared`), cCRE architecture (PLS/pELS/dELS counts and match percentages, CTCF-bound fractions) and BTM membership.

For the classification task two framings are compared:
- **A (predictive):** retains the mouse magnitude (`mean_log2fc_mouse`, `rank_mouse_btm`).
- **B (explanatory):** removes the mouse magnitude to test the biological layers alone.

#### VIII.B.2 Universes, targets and ranks
Two gene universes are defined:
1. **All human DEGs** (`p_adj_human <= 0.05`) — rank transfer and direction.
2. **Mouse LEGs** (`Shared` or `Mouse only`, BTM scope) — shared-LEG classification.

Each gene receives an **absolute rank** (0–100) from the percentile of $|\text{Log}_2\text{FC}| \times -\log_{10}(\text{adjusted } P)$ within its universe and condition:

$$\text{rank} = \text{percent\_rank}\left(|\text{Log}_2\text{FC}| \times -\log_{10}(\text{adj. } P)\right) \times 100$$

Targets:
- **Rank transfer:** `rank_human` (continuous, 0–100).
- **Direction:** `sign_concordant = sign(Log2FC_mouse) == sign(Log2FC_human)` (binary).
- **Shared-LEG classification:** `Shared` vs `Mouse only` (binary).

Derived metrics: $\text{rank\_diff} = |\text{rank\_mouse} - \text{rank\_human}|$ (convergence) and $\text{dual\_rank} = \min(\text{rank\_mouse}, \text{rank\_human})$ (relevance).

#### VIII.B.3 Leave-one-pathogen-out cross-validation
To avoid optimistic bias, models are evaluated by **leave-one-pathogen-out (LOCO)** cross-validation over the four infection/injury folds (*S. aureus*, *E. coli*, Burn, Trauma). Every gene is predicted by a model trained without its pathogen; these out-of-fold predictions feed both the metrics and the exported scores.

#### VIII.B.4 Algorithms benchmarked
Four paradigms are compared under identical recipes (`step_dummy`, `step_zv`/`step_nzv`, `step_corr` for classification at threshold 0.9, and `step_normalize`):
1. **Linear/logistic regression** (baseline).
2. **Lasso** (`glmnet`, `mixture = 1`, penalty = 0.01). Skipped automatically when fewer than two predictors remain (glmnet requires $\ge 2$).
3. **Random forest** (`ranger`, 500 trees, `mtry = 8`, `min_n = 5`, Gini importance).
4. **Neural network** (`nnet`, one hidden layer of 10 units, `epochs = 200`, weight decay 0.01).

The **random forest was the best algorithm for rank transfer and directional concordance**; for shared-LEG classification the **lasso was marginally better by ROC-AUC**. The lasso improved only marginally over the unregularised linear model for shared-LEG classification and not at all for rank transfer or direction, indicating that the transferable signal for rank and direction is predominantly non-linear and multivariate.

#### VIII.B.5 Performance metrics
- **Classification (shared LEGs, direction):** ROC-AUC and PR-AUC (`yardstick`).
- **Regression (rank transfer):** $R^2$ and RMSE.

Out-of-fold LOCO results (best feature set per task):

| Task | Metric | Random Forest | Neural Network | Lasso | Linear |
|:-----|:-------|:-------------:|:--------------:|:-----:|:------:|
| Shared LEGs (predictive, Full + BTM) | ROC-AUC | 0.572 | 0.615 | **0.617** | 0.601 |
| Shared LEGs (explanatory, Full + BTM) | ROC-AUC | 0.622 | 0.603 | **0.627** | 0.611 |
| Human rank transfer (Mouse + layers) | $R^2$ | **0.234** | 0.068 | 0.072 | 0.072 |
| Directional concordance (Direction + layers) | ROC-AUC | **0.849** | 0.619 | 0.517 | 0.529 |

#### VIII.B.6 Out-of-fold scores
From the best model per task, four scores are exported (each gene scored by a model trained without its condition):
- `score_shared` — probability of being a shared LEG.
- `score_rank` — predicted human absolute rank (0–100).
- `score_direction` — probability of concordant direction.
- `score_translational` — $\text{score\_rank} \times \text{score\_direction}$.

#### VIII.B.7 Model serialisation and application
The best workflows are reduced with `butcher()` and stored with `compress = "xz"` (`rf_model_*.rds`, `nn_model_*.rds` in `Modelling/Models/`) so they can be reloaded and applied to new mouse experiments with `predict()`. Two resources consume these artefacts directly: the **recommended step-by-step R Markdown notebook** (`Run your analysis here/RunYourAnalysis_MouseToHuman.Rmd`), which walks through DGE input, GSEA, prediction and score visualisation, and an **optional interactive flexdashboard / Shiny app** (`Run your analysis here/MouseToHuman_app.Rmd`) that provides the same workflow through a browser interface.
